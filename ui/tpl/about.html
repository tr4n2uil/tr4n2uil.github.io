                    <!-- <br>
                    <span>I love my small family (father, mother and a little sister).</span> -->

                    <br>
                    <span>Beginning from reading Tinkle comics which my father bought for me, I always love little things in life which are orthogonal to "race to be the best" norm in the society, and that makes me the unconventional I am.</span>

                    <br>
                    <span>I deeply love the inner voice that guides me wherever I am confronted with confusion or otherwise. And amazingly, I feel the reciprocation of that in different people at different times in different phases of my life.</span> -->

                    <span>After securing 90+ in my Xth and XIIth, I was fortunate to qualilfy IIT JEE 2008 with an AIR of 2984 and get into IIT (BHU) Varanasi for M. Tech. (IDD) course in Computer Science & Engineering.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>Getting a laptop towards the end of first year, I loved to study technologies that make computers work and do wonderful things. In the second year, our team was selected for interview in IBM TGMC contest.</span>

                    <br>
                    <span>In my third year, I started with concentrating on web technology stack after working for Codefest Server Team. The year ended with a big surprise of getting selected for GSoC and thus started my entry into the fascinating world of open source.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>Since then, I have been regularly dedicating myself to create open technologies that will one day help me in making the dreams of many people come true.
