					span I was born in small town in Kannur, Kerala and bought up in Nerul, Navi Mumbai.
					br
					span I love my small family (father, mother and a little sister).
					br
					br

					span Beginning from reading Tinkle comics which my father bought for me, I always love little things in life which are orthogonal to "race to be the best" norm in the society.

Positions of responsibility which I held thereon included Co-ordinator for Adhyayan 2012 and the Training &amp; Placement Representative for CSE 2013 batch.

					span The final year gifted me an internship opportunity at Yahoo! and then it saw me taking a jump into the world of entrepreneurship with Orbitnote. Learning from failures and successes, the journey now continues ...
